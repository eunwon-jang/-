# Hybrid Suspension System Simulation

This repository contains the modeling, simulation, and analysis of a quarter-car suspension system, focusing on step response, sinusoidal input, and road bump effects.

## Contents
- 📐 System modeling
- 🧪 MATLAB simulations (step, sine, bump input)
- 📊 Frequency domain analysis (Bode plot)
- 📈 RMS acceleration evaluation
- 📝 Final report

## Getting Started
MATLAB scripts are provided in the `/simulation` folder.  
Run `step_response.m`, `sine_input_response.m`, and `bump_input_response.m` sequentially.

## Result Summary
- RMS Acceleration: **331.11 m/s²**
- System transfer function:
